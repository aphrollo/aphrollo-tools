# aphrollo-tools

First-party dev-env tooling for the Aphrollo agent platform, shipped as a single
zero-dependency Go binary: **`aphrollo`**. The goal is to move deterministic
developer work *out of the agent token stream into code* — the agent spends
tokens on judgment, not on mechanical read→grep→multi-edit→verify loops.

Design contract for every tool here:

- **Lossless** — never silently transform, truncate, or filter output.
- **Deterministic** — same inputs, same bytes out (sorted, stable).
- **Visible** — dry-run by default; show exactly what would change before it
  changes; fail loud with a fix suggestion rather than guessing.

## Install

```sh
go build -o aphrollo ./cmd/aphrollo
# put it on PATH (coder sessions inherit PATH)
```

The refactor commands shell out to per-language LSP servers; install the ones
you need:

| Language | Extensions | Server (must be on PATH) | e2e-validated |
|---|---|---|---|
| Go | `.go` | `gopls` | ✅ |
| Rust | `.rs` | `rust-analyzer` | ✅ |
| Python | `.py` | `pyright-langserver` | ✅ |
| TS/JS | `.ts .tsx .js .jsx` | `typescript-language-server` | ✅ |

The architecture is language-agnostic (one LSP client, one registry entry per
language). Each language has a real end-to-end test against its actual server
(skipped automatically when the server isn't installed). Slow-loading servers
(notably rust-analyzer, which waits on `cargo metadata`) are handled by a
bounded retry on transient "still loading" responses.

## Usage

### Rename a symbol (and all references) across the project

```sh
# dry-run: prints a unified diff of every file that would change
aphrollo refactor rename-symbol --file internal/foo/bar.go --line 42 --symbol OldName --new-name NewName

# apply to disk
aphrollo refactor rename-symbol --file ... --line 42 --symbol OldName --new-name NewName --apply
```

Locate the target with either `--symbol NAME` (resolved to the right column on
that line, UTF-16-correct — paste it straight from a grep hit) or an explicit
`--col` (1-based UTF-16).

### Find every reference to a symbol

```sh
aphrollo refactor find-references --file internal/foo/bar.go --line 42 --symbol Name
# internal/foo/bar.go:42:6: func Name() string {
# internal/foo/baz.go:9:9:  return Name()
```

Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` runtime error, `2` usage error.

## Layout

```
cmd/aphrollo/        entry point (one-liner over internal/cli)
internal/cli/        arg parsing + subcommand dispatch (testable Run)
internal/refactor/   orchestration: detect lang → spawn server → rename/refs
internal/lsp/        LSP types + JSON-RPC stdio client (framing, Conn, edits)
internal/diff/       deterministic unified-diff renderer
```

## Known limitations (v1)

- `--col`/`--symbol` and reference columns are UTF-16 code units (the LSP
  convention), not bytes — exact for ASCII, and `--symbol` always resolves
  correctly regardless.
- Unified diffs assume newline-terminated files; a missing final newline is not
  annotated with `\ No newline at end of file`.
- Diff headers use the file path verbatim (`a/<path>`); absolute paths render as
  `a//abs/path`. The diff is for reading and for our own `--apply` (which writes
  files directly, not via `git apply`).
```
